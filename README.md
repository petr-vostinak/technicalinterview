# Tandem Android Tech Challenge

## Getting Started

Pull down this repo and open in Android
Studio [https://github.com/tandem-matt-perkins/Emoji](https://github.com/tandem-matt-perkins/Emoji).

After opening and syncing the project, open the "TODO" tool window to see a list of tasks to
complete in this activity.

### Goals
1. Build an app that downloads a list of emojis from: [https://emoji-api.com/emojis?access_key=352a31dea84f985ea8f35049d2fb4d268310e14e](https://emoji-api.com/emojis?access_key=352a31dea84f985ea8f35049d2fb4d268310e14e)
2. Using the data that is downloaded, display a list of emoji names and emojis

You are free to use any web and json library you prefer.  We have already added common libraries to the project, but you can always add something else if you prefer.
   
### Bonus Points

1. Use of dependency injection. Whether you prefer Hilt/Dagger, Koin, or something else,
   demonstrating your understanding of how to use DI won't hurt.
2. Test your code. Demonstrate your skills in proving that the code you write handles the happy and
   unhappy paths that are possible using unit/instrumented tests.
